<hr>
<h2 id="i---markets-are-mercyless">I - Markets are Mercyless</h2>
<p>Markets do not optimize for justice, sustainability, or long-term collective outcomes but only for pareto-efficiency.<br>
They optimize only under strict assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>competition is fair</li>
<li>information is available</li>
<li>switching costs are low</li>
<li>feedback is fast</li>
</ul>
<p>Mobility violates <strong>all</strong> of these.</p>
<p>The result is not efficiency, but <strong>path dependence</strong>: once a system is built, the cheapest move is to keep using it, even if it is globally worse.</p>
<p>Cars dominate not because they are optimal, but because:</p>
<ul>
<li>infrastructure is already paid for</li>
<li>regulations are written around them</li>
<li>habits and skills are formed around them</li>
<li>alternatives must compete against sunk costs</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a moral failure. It is an economic one.</p>
<p>A Pareto-efficient outcome can still be absurd.<br>
(A system where a few thousand people own more wealth than billions of others is Pareto-efficient too.)[https://wir2026.wid.world/insight/global-economic-inequity/]</p>
<p>The relevant question is therefore not:<br>
“Why don’t markets choose better mobility?”<br>
but:<br>
<strong>“Where do markets misprice costs and benefits and can we exploit that gap?”</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ii---moloch">II - Moloch</h2>
<p>Unchecked competition often produces what (Scott Alexander describes as <strong>Moloch traps</strong>)[https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Meditations-On-Moloch]:<br>
situations where individually rational choices lead to collectively worse outcomes.</p>
<p>Classic examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>arms races</li>
<li>overfishing</li>
<li>race-to-the-bottom labor practices</li>
</ul>
<p>Mobility is no different.</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals choose cars because infrastructure and safety reward them</li>
<li>Cities design for cars because voters already drive</li>
<li>Companies build cars because that’s where demand and capital already are</li>
</ul>
<p>No one is irrational.<br>
The equilibrium is still destructive.</p>
<p>From a “god’s-eye view,” cooperation would clearly dominate.<br>
From inside the system, unilateral deviation is punished.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t blame the players, blame the rules&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="iii---the-véli-paradox-too-late-too-early">III - The Véli Paradox: Too Late, Too Early</h2>
<p>The emergence of <em>véli</em> (véhicules intermédiaires légers) or LEVs across Europe is not accidental.<br>
They respond to a real discomfort: cars are oversized for daily life, yet alternatives feel incomplete.</p>
<p>And yet, most of these projects stall.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they sit between two systems that already work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bicycles</strong>, which are cheap, regulated, repairable, culturally accepted, and infrastructure-compatible</li>
<li><strong>Cars</strong>, which handle edge cases at massive scale</li>
</ul>
<p>Any véli must survive three brutal comparisons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Against the bike: cost, simplicity, regulation, repairability</li>
<li>Against the car: comfort, perceived safety, legitimacy</li>
<li>Against inertia: doing nothing costs nothing</li>
</ol>
<p>If a véli is only <em>slightly</em> better on a few dimensions, it loses.</p>
<p>As Philippe Meda argues in<br>
<a href="https://www.icopilots.com/the-veli-question-can-a-good-idea-become-a-market/">“The Véli Question: Can a ‘good’ idea become a market?”</a><br>
markets do not buy virtue. They buy outcomes.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="iv---reframing-the-problem-who-pays-who-uses-who-benefits">IV - Reframing the Problem: Who Pays, Who Uses, Who Benefits</h2>
<p>A useful way to de-romanticize mobility is to split roles.</p>
<h3 id="1-who-pays">1. Who pays?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Households (purchase, insurance, maintenance)</li>
<li>Cities (infrastructure, parking, enforcement)</li>
<li>Society (health costs, pollution, climate, direct and indirect subsidies)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-who-uses">2. Who uses?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Often one adult</li>
<li>Vehicles idle most of the time</li>
<li>Capacity massively underutilized</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-who-benefits">3. Who benefits?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Individual: flexibility, time savings</li>
<li>Employer: punctuality, labor pool from a much larger area</li>
<li>A few big company: Selling oil, selling parts, selling cars, selling insurance, &hellip;</li>
<li>Society: suffer from externalities</li>
</ul>
<p>Cars collapse these roles into one illusion:<br>
<em>the user thinks they pay the full cost, but they don’t.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="v---economic-choice-under-real-life-constraints">V - Economic Choice Under Real-Life Constraints</h2>
<p>This builds on the motility framework introduced earlier.<br>
We treat <strong>access, competence, and appropriation</strong> as given constraints that shape economic behavior.<br>
What follows focuses strictly on <strong>cost structures, substitution thresholds, and economic choice</strong>.</p>
<p>People do not choose mobility modes by optimizing energy, speed, or emissions.<br>
They choose among <strong>viable options</strong> given their income, habits, household structure, and coordination needs.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1---a-few-household-mobility-scenarios-public-transport-and-feasible-choices">1 - A few Household Mobility Scenarios, Public Transport, and Feasible Choices</h3>
<p>Mobility choices emerge from the interaction between <strong>public transport pricing</strong>, <strong>coordination needs</strong>, and <strong>redundancy costs</strong>.
Public transport can either simplify life by replacing cars or, paradoxically, make alternatives harder to justify once it is already paid for.
We describe a few broad category. they are not exaustive and come along a spectrum of individual with unique lives but will help for this argument.</p>
<h4 id="a-dense-urban-aligned-life">A) Dense urban, aligned life</h4>
<p>Home, work, and social life are concentrated within a dense urban fabric, with frequent and reliable public transport.</p>
<ul>
<li>Urban PT subscription: <strong>~120–180 CHF / month</strong></li>
<li>Walking, bike, cargo bike</li>
<li>Car: optional or absent</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, public transport acts as a <strong>coordination backbone</strong>.<br>
Once the subscription is paid, marginal trips feel “free,” lowering the incentive to add another vehicle.</p>
<p>Economically and functionally, the bike-PT system already dominates.<br>
A véli struggles to justify itself unless it replaces specific trips that PT handles poorly (time, comfort, reliability), which is rare in this context.</p>
<h4 id="b-city-to-city-commuter">B) City-to-city commuter</h4>
<p>Regular long-distance travel between major urban centers.</p>
<ul>
<li>General pass (AG): <strong>~450 CHF / month</strong></li>
<li>Car: generally hight in total cost, higher stress and variability</li>
</ul>
<p>The AG creates a <strong>high sunk cost</strong> with maximal coverage.<br>
Once paid, it crowds out intermediate solutions: adding a light vehicle does not reduce the PT cost and add little marginal utility.</p>
<p>Light vehicles do not compete here - neither economically nor cognitively.</p>
<h4 id="c-peri-urban-or-rural-household">C) Peri-urban or rural household</h4>
<p>Dispersed activities, weaker public transport, overlapping schedules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Public transport: limited, fragmented, often <strong>still paid</strong> (partial subscriptions, school passes)</li>
<li>Primary car: unavoidable</li>
<li>Second car: enables independence and schedule overlap</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, public transport is neither cheap enough nor comprehensive enough to act as a backbone.<br>
Instead, it coexists with the car without removing the need for redundancy.</p>
<p>The second car exists as a <strong>coordination failure buffer</strong>, not because it is loved, but because schedules break without it and public transport are not viable either economically or practically.</p>
<p>The only scenario where economic substitution is plausible is by replacing <em>redundancy</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2---the-reference-cost-a-typical-second-car-ch">2 - The Reference Cost: A Typical Second Car (CH)</h3>
<p>For households in scenario C, the second car defines part of the economic benchmark.</p>
<p>A conservative monthly cost breakdown in Switzerland:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase amortization: <strong>150–800 CHF</strong></li>
<li>Insurance &amp; taxes: <strong>20-50 CHF</strong></li>
<li>Fuel / electricity: <strong>20–200 CHF</strong></li>
<li>Maintenance &amp; tires: <strong>10–250 CHF</strong></li>
<li>Parking (often ignored): <strong>50–150 CHF</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total:</strong> <strong>~250–1450 CHF / month</strong></p>
<p>This cost is widely tolerated because it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>fragmented across categories</li>
<li>partly invisible (depreciation, parking)</li>
<li>normalized by long-standing car dependency</li>
</ul>
<p>Public transport costs do not eliminate this expense;<br>
they often <strong>stack on top of it</strong>, increasing total household mobility spending.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3---the-100200-chf--month-substitution-window">3 - The 100–200 CHF / Month Substitution Window</h3>
<p>Once the second-car cost is made explicit, a hard constraint appears.</p>
<p>To substitute meaningfully, an alternative must sit well below the marginal cost of redundancy <em>and below the psychological threshold from public transport</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&lt;100 CHF / month</strong><br>
→ low-friction experimentation, easy addition alongside PT</li>
<li><strong>100–150 CHF / month</strong><br>
→ rational second-car substitution</li>
<li><strong>&gt;200 CHF / month</strong><br>
→ ideological or hobbyist choice</li>
</ul>
<p>Above <strong>200 CHF / month</strong>, an alternative no longer competes with a second car.<br>
It competes with values, identity, or novelty but not budgets.</p>
<p>This window defines upper bounds on:</p>
<ul>
<li>manufacturing cost</li>
<li>acceptable lifespan assumptions</li>
<li>insurance and liability models</li>
<li>maintenance burden</li>
<li>financing structure</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not design preferences.<br>
They are <strong>economic thresholds</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4---economic-implication-for-neodrive">4 - Economic Implication for Neodrive</h3>
<p>Neodrive does not target:</p>
<ul>
<li>primary car replacement</li>
<li>dense urban cores</li>
<li>long-distance commuting</li>
</ul>
<p>Its economic hypothesis is narrow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A vehicle that replaces the second car’s <em>function</em><br>
while undercutting its <em>monthly marginal cost</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To remain within the substitution window, this implies:</p>
<ul>
<li>extreme durability</li>
<li>minimal depreciation</li>
<li>low insurance exposure</li>
<li>predictable maintenance</li>
<li>capital-light production choices</li>
</ul>
<p>Any design choice that violates these constraints is not a trade-off.<br>
It is a disqualifier.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="5---value-creation-capture-and-distribution">5 - Value Creation, Capture, and Distribution</h3>
<p>In this framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User</strong> values independence and reduced coordination cost</li>
<li><strong>Payer</strong> seeks lower monthly outlay than a second car</li>
<li><strong>Beneficiary</strong> society and the planet (hopefully)</li>
</ul>
<p>Value is created by:</p>
<ul>
<li>reducing redundant capital</li>
<li>lowering fixed mobility costs</li>
<li>maintaining autonomy without escalation</li>
</ul>
<p>What is clear is the non-goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>extracting rent</li>
<li>feature gating</li>
<li>planned obsolescence</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="6---economic-scope-and-scale">6 - Economic Scope and Scale</h3>
<p>This is not a mass-market ambition.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TAM</strong>: all multi-car households</li>
<li><strong>SAM</strong>: households with short-to-medium daily trips and bike-compatible infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>SOM</strong>: households willing to substitute redundancy with a non-car vehicle</li>
</ul>
<p>The SOM is small by design.<br>
Viability here depends on <strong>stability</strong>, not volume.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="7---what-this-chapter-establishes">7 - What This Chapter Establishes</h3>
<p>This chapter does not argue that Neodrive will succeed.<br>
It establishes the <strong>economic conditions under which it could</strong>.</p>
<p>If the vehicle cannot:</p>
<ul>
<li>stay below the 150 CHF / month threshold</li>
<li>replace second-car functionality</li>
<li>avoid increasing coordination or cognitive cost</li>
</ul>
<p>then no amount of ethical intent or technical elegance will compensate.</p>
<p>Markets do not negotiate with good intentions.
They only respond to relieved constraints.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="vi---industrial-reality-and-value-lock-in">VI - Industrial Reality and Value Lock-In</h2>
<p>Cars are cheap not because they are elegant.<br>
They are cheap because they are <strong>standardized mistakes produced billions of times</strong>.</p>
<p>This creates brutal advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>custom parts at near-raw-material cost</li>
<li>amortized tooling and certification</li>
<li>massive learning curves</li>
</ul>
<p>Small-scale innovation is punished:</p>
<ul>
<li>bespoke components destroy economies of scale</li>
<li>certification costs do not scale down</li>
<li>supply chains do not care about ethics</li>
</ul>
<p>This is <strong>value lock-in</strong>.</p>
<p>For Neodrive, the implication is clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We cannot out-car the car.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must:</p>
<ul>
<li>reuse existing industrial ecosystems</li>
<li>rely on commodity parts</li>
<li>prioritize repairability over optimization</li>
<li>accept imperfection and tradeoff</li>
</ul>
<p>A unperfect vehicle that lasts 20 years beats a beautiful and expensive one that never make it on the market.</p>

<h2 id="vii---ethics-without-illusions">VII - Ethics Without Illusions</h2>
<p>Markets do not reward virtue.<br>
They sometimes tolerate it when it is cheap.</p>
<p>Our ethical constraints are not selling points:</p>
<ul>
<li>long lifespan</li>
<li>repair-first design</li>
<li>open knowledge</li>
<li>refusal of rent extraction</li>
</ul>
<p>These do not justify existence.<br>
They justify <strong>how</strong> we operate <em>if</em> existence is earned.</p>
<p>Ethics are just extra constraints (economically speaking), and moral is not rewarded by the market.</p>

<h2 id="viii---what-neodrive-is-actually-trying-to-prove">VIII - What Neodrive Is Actually Trying to Prove</h2>
<p>Neodrive is not a promise.<br>
It is a test.</p>
<p>We aim to explore whether a vehicle can:</p>
<ul>
<li>replace a second car and reduce negative externalities on the environment</li>
<li>cost less than <strong>150 CHF / month</strong></li>
<li>integrate into bicycle infrastructure</li>
<li>rely on existing industrial parts</li>
<li>last <strong>20+ years</strong></li>
<li>without betting on regulatory miracles</li>
</ul>
<p>all of that to get a foodhold to drive the economy of scale lower and hopefully start to replace the rest of the cars by being brutally cheaper.</p>
<p>In practive that mean designing a vehicle that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAYhNHhxN0A">can cost less than 5k CHF from a volume of a dozens per years.</a></p>
