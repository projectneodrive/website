                <p>We start from a simple observation:<br>
for most daily trips, neither cars nor bikes fully match human needs.</p>
<p>Cars provide comfort, protection, and a sense of safety but at a high environmental and spatial cost.<br>
Bikes are extremely efficient but often fail on comfort, cargo capacity, weather protection, perceived safety in traffic, and require physical effort.</p>
<p>Neodrive explores what exists <strong>between</strong> these two extremes, deliberately seeking a <strong>balance between user needs and environmental limits</strong>.<br>
We aim not for perfection in one dimension, but for a thoughtful compromise that serves people <strong>and</strong> the planet—operating as close as possible to true needs without indulging in excess.</p>
<p>Rather than designing a single “perfect” vehicle, we treat Neodrive as a <strong>research project</strong>.<br>
We develop <strong>light, intermediate vehicles</strong>, iterate on their design, and test them with real users in real conditions.</p>
<p>Each iteration is an experiment.<br>
By changing geometry, weight, enclosure, assistance, or usability details, we study how design choices influence <strong>modal choice</strong>, comfort, confidence, and day-to-day practicality, while keeping environmental impact in mind.</p>
<p>Scaling mobility solutions is not just a design challenge. It’s also a race against systemic inertia.<br>
While Tesla was able to bring electric cars to market in a few years, building high-quality cycling infrastructure in many cities takes decades.<br>
This contrast highlights why light, adaptable vehicles like Neodrive, combined with open, iterative testing, are essential: they allow innovation to move faster than slow-moving infrastructure, meeting real user needs today.</p>
<p>Our goal is not only to build a better vehicle, but to understand <strong>what actually helps people shift away from car dependency</strong> <strong>without exceeding planetary limits</strong>.</p>
<p>We do this work openly.<br>
Designs, results, and failures are shared publicly, so others can learn, adapt, and build upon them.</p>
<p><strong>Neodrive is guided by compromise</strong>: no single metric dominates, and every design choice balances comfort, safety, usability, efficiency, and sustainability.</p>
