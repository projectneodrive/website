<p>Private cars account for approximately <strong>13% of Europe’s total greenhouse gas emissions</strong>.<br>
Yet climate impact is only part of the problem.</p>
<p>For everyday mobility, cars are fundamentally inefficient.<br>
A typical car consumes <strong>around 10 to 100 times more energy per kilometer</strong> than a bicycle, while carrying on average <strong>1.4 people in a 5-seat vehicle</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>80% of trips in Europe are under 10 km.</strong><br>
These journeys rarely require long range, high speed, or large payloads, yet they are made with vehicles weighing over a ton and designed for highways.</p>
<p>This mismatch creates cascading effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traffic congestion</strong>, because large vehicles occupy too much space for the number of people moved.</li>
<li><strong>Parking shortages</strong>, as each trip requires storage at both ends.</li>
<li><strong>Noise and danger</strong>, particularly in dense urban environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cars also impose a heavy <strong>land footprint</strong>.<br>
Roads, parking spaces, and safety margins reshape cities around the car’s worst-case size. Urban space is consumed not by movement, but by stationary vehicles, pushing destinations farther apart and reinforcing car dependency.</p>
<p>Alternatives for short trips exist like bikes and e-bikes or public transport yet they are <strong>not widely adopted</strong>.<br>
This is not a failure of individuals, but of systems and design. Habits and value lock-in, perceived safety in traffic, physical effort, exposure to weather, time variability, and the cognitive load of trip chaining all favor the car, even when it is inefficient.</p>
<p>The core issue is not that people choose cars.<br>
It is that <strong>cars have become the default solution to problems they were never meant to solve</strong>.</p>
