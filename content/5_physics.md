There are the laws of men, and the laws of nature. The latter cannot be broken.  
Nature does not negotiate. At human scale, a few parameters dominate almost everything.  
**Dura lex, sed lex!**

# Mass matters everywhere

Weight drives almost everything: the resources needed to build a vehicle, the energy required for every acceleration, climb, or stop.  
It increases rolling resistance, amplifies non-exhaust pollution, and multiplies the energy involved in crashes.  

Reducing mass is one of the most effective ways to reduce environmental and safety impact across the system.  
Higher mass requires heavier tires, often with worse rolling resistance, which compounds the inefficiency.

# Speed is expensive

Aerodynamic drag grows with the square of speed, and the power required to overcome it grows with the cube.
Even light vehicles quickly reach a point where small increases in speed come at a massive energy cost — often around 20–30 km/h.

Some automakers historically ignored aerodynamics, hoping to brute-force physics with bigger engines.
As Enzo Ferrari famously quipped:

> “Aerodynamics are for people who can’t build engines.”

We can now gently remind Signor Ferrari that drag grows with the **square** of speed, engine power grows linearly at best, and no matter how magnificent your engine, horsepower cannot escape air resistance. 
Shape and frontal area matters more.

# Aerodynamics matter sooner than intuition suggests

At 30–50 km/h, drag dominates rolling resistance aldready.  
Frontal area, flow separation, and shape are just as important as drivetrain efficiency.  
Lightweight, slender designs reduce energy use before even touching the question of energy storage.

# Powertrain efficiency

Thermal engines are inherently limited: about 20% efficient at best.  
Electric motors can exceed 80% efficiency, dramatically reducing the energy cost per kilometer.  
But as we saw with EV, power train efficiency alone does not solve the issue. Plus rebound effect for the embodied energy required by the now even heavier and ressource intence vehicle mitigate a lot of the benefit...

# Safety

Imagine driving a tank: you feel invincible inside, but everyone around you is less safe.  
A heavier car may protect its occupants, but collisions with lighter vehicles or vulnerable users transfer enormous energy.  
Since collision energy grows with mass and the square of speed, **speed matters more than mass**.  

Designing for safety is therefore an ethical as well as technical problem:  
we cannot optimize only for occupants without considering others.  

# Range and energy storage

Batteries are not perfect, they are like chemotherapy: not harmless, but necessary in some context.  
The “poison” is proportional to how much you carry. Massive batteries increase rare-earth extraction, weight penalties, and inefficiency.  

Range should be treated realistically. Most daily trips are 20–50 km.  
We can design batteries for that reality, smaller, lighter, more repairable, because our vehicle efficiency drastically reduces energy needs.  

Other storage ideas deserve exploration too: compressed air, simpler chemistries, even wild concepts to fully remove the conflicts mineral from the equation.

This is a fundamental constraint: range is constrained by what you carry.


![Efficiency plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectneodrive/efficiency-frontier/main/Efficiency.png "Efficiency Plot")

The **Efficiency plot** illustrates how energy consumption varies with speed across a range of vehicles. Modern petrol cars, like a typical hatchback, and historical models, such as the Citroën 2CV, show high energy use at even moderate speeds. Electric cars, such as a Tesla Model 3 or a Prius in electric mode, achieve lower energy per kilometer, but the gain are relatively modest in order of 3-5 time. One the other hands, light vehicles, including bicycles like the CityEL, or pedal-assisted models like the Twike which where designed almost 50 years ago, sit far below conventional and electric cars in energy use, especially at urban speeds (20–50 km/h). Trains also show strong efficiency at higher speeds due to reduced rolling resistance and the fact that the aerodynamic drag is compensated by the very large number of people it can move at once.

This plot highlights a fundamental insight: **vehicle mass and aerodynamics dominate energy consumption**, and lighter, streamlined designs achieve massive efficiency gains before even considering the type of powertrain. It emphasizes why reducing weight and frontal area is critical for sustainable mobility, particularly for city travel where conventional cars are extremely overpowered for the task.
