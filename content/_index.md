# We aim to drastically reduce the impact of personal mobility on the world.

Private cars account for **13% of Europe’s total greenhouse gas emissions**.  
And they are deeply inefficient: a typical car consumes approximately **10 times more energy per kilometer** than riding a bike.

But emissions are just one problem.  
Cars also drive **traffic congestion**, **parking shortages**, **noise pollution**, and many other concerning issues.

**80% of trips in Europe are under 10 km**, with an average of just **1.4 people per car**.  
Yet cars offer **5 seats** that are unused the vast majority of the time.

Solutions like bikes to replace these short trips exist — but are **not widely adopted**.  
We believe that by retaining the **safety**, **comfort**, and **ergonomics** of a car with the **efficiency of a velomobile**, we can solve the adoption issue and truly make an impact.
