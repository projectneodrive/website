## The problem
Cars are inefficient, polluting, and overkill for most everyday trips.
Most journeys are short, and most car seats are empty.

## Our approach
Neodrive is a research project around **light, weather-protected, human-scaled vehicle**.
The goal is to understand how vehicle design can combine what people value in cars with the social and climate efficiency of bicycles, in order to reduce reliance on cars.
Our mission : **drastically reduce the impact of personal mobility on the world**.
