# Neodrive: mobility, rethought.

Cars are inefficient, polluting, and overkill for most everyday trips.  
Most journeys are short, and most car seats are empty.

Neodrive is a **light, weather-protected, human-scaled vehicle** that combines the **comfort and perceived safety of a car** with the **efficiency of a bike**.

Our mission is simple: **drastically reduce the impact of personal mobility on the world**.
