We start from a simple observation:  
for most daily trips, neither cars nor bikes fully match human needs.

Cars provide comfort, protection, and a sense of safety but at a high environmental and spatial cost.  
Bikes are extremely efficient but often fail on comfort, cargo capacity, weather protection, perceived safety in traffic, and require physical effort.

Neodrive explores what exists **between** these two extremes, deliberately seeking a **balance between user needs and environmental limits**.  
We aim not for perfection in one dimension, but for a thoughtful compromise that serves people **and** the planet.
We aim to operate as close as possible to true needs without indulging in excess.

Rather than designing a single “perfect” vehicle, we treat Neodrive as a **research project**.  
We develop **light, intermediate vehicles**, iterate on their design, and test them with real users in real conditions.

Each iteration is an experiment.  
By changing geometry, weight, enclosure, assistance, or usability details, we study how design choices influence **modal choice**, comfort, confidence, and day-to-day practicality..

Scaling mobility isn’t just a design challenge. It’s a race against systemic inertia. Infrastructure like high-quality cycling networks evolves at a glacial pace and the climate cannot wait any longer. Products like Tesla have shown that rapid adoption is possible: even if electric cars only (very) partially reduce emissions, they replaced a significant portion of conventional vehicles in a few years. Neodrive takes a similar approach for urban mobility: by bypassing slow-moving political and infrastructural barriers, we aim at offering a fast-deploying, practical solution that reduces car dependence today, especially in contexts where alternatives aren’t yet financially viable.

Our goal is not only to build a better vehicle, but to understand **what actually helps people shift away from car dependency** **without exceeding planetary limits**.

We do this work openly.  
Designs, results, and failures are shared publicly, so others can learn, adapt, and build upon them.

**Neodrive is guided by compromise**: no single metric dominates, and every design choice balances comfort, safety, usability, efficiency, and sustainability.
