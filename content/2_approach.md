We start from a simple observation:  
for most daily trips, neither cars nor bikes fully match human needs.

Cars provide comfort, protection, and a sense of safety but at a high environmental and spatial cost.  
Bikes are extremely efficient but often fail on comfort, cargo capacity, weather protection, perceived safety in traffic, and require physical effort.

Neodrive explores what exists **between** these two extremes, deliberately seeking a **balance between user needs and environmental limits**.  
We aim not for perfection in one dimension, but for a thoughtful compromise that serves people **and** the planet—operating as close as possible to true needs without indulging in excess.

Rather than designing a single “perfect” vehicle, we treat Neodrive as a **research project**.  
We develop **light, intermediate vehicles**, iterate on their design, and test them with real users in real conditions.

Each iteration is an experiment.  
By changing geometry, weight, enclosure, assistance, or usability details, we study how design choices influence **modal choice**, comfort, confidence, and day-to-day practicality, while keeping environmental impact in mind.

Scaling mobility solutions is not just a design challenge. It’s also a race against systemic inertia.  
While Tesla was able to bring electric cars to market in a few years, building high-quality cycling infrastructure in many cities takes decades.  
This contrast highlights why light, adaptable vehicles like Neodrive, combined with open, iterative testing, are essential: they allow innovation to move faster than slow-moving infrastructure, meeting real user needs today.

Our goal is not only to build a better vehicle, but to understand **what actually helps people shift away from car dependency** **without exceeding planetary limits**.

We do this work openly.  
Designs, results, and failures are shared publicly, so others can learn, adapt, and build upon them.

**Neodrive is guided by compromise**: no single metric dominates, and every design choice balances comfort, safety, usability, efficiency, and sustainability.
