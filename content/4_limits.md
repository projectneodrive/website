Human mobility operates within physical and ecological boundaries.  
These limits are not political opinions.  
They are hard constraints imposed by the planet.

## I - Planetary Limits Are Not Negotiable

Climate change is the clearest signal that humanity is exceeding planetary limits.  
Even though the CO₂ we emit represents only a tiny fraction of the atmosphere, it acts like a thermal blanket: trapping infrared radiation, raising global temperatures, and destabilizing weather patterns.

This small change has outsized effects because the climate system is highly sensitive and tightly coupled.  
Slight imbalances can trigger heatwaves, floods, storms, and droughts.

Ecosystems cannot adapt fast enough.  
Species face habitat loss, forced migration, and disrupted seasonal cycles, leading to declines and extinctions.  
These disruptions cascade into human societies, affecting food production, water availability, health, infrastructure, and economic stability.

In Earth’s history, changes of this magnitude and speed are exceptional.  
The closest analogs : asteroid impacts or massive volcanic events that coincided with mass extinctions :)   
The current rate of change is **faster than almost anything in the planet’s geological record**, leaving little time to adapt.

## II - Mobility as a Structural Driver of Impact

Transport is one of the few sectors where emissions continue to grow, and it is the largest emitter in Europe after energy.  
Private cars alone account for more than **10% of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions**.

Focusing only on carbon, however, misses much of the picture.

Mobility systems exert pressure through multiple channels:
- greenhouse gas emissions
- material extraction
- land use
- pollution
- ecological fragmentation

These effects accumulate and reinforce each other over decades.

## III - Beyond Carbon: The Hidden Externalities of Cars

Cars generate **non-exhaust pollution** from tire and brake wear, a major source of fine particulates in cities.  
Traffic noise disrupts ecosystems and degrades human health.  
Roads and vehicles cause direct wildlife mortality and fragment habitats into isolated zones.

The spatial footprint is equally significant.  
Roads, parking, and safety buffers consume land, seal soil, alter water flows, and lock cities into sprawl.  
Once built, this infrastructure commits societies to long-term resource use and emissions, regardless of future vehicle improvements.

## IV - Why Electrification Is Not Enough

Electrification reduces tailpipe emissions, but it does not eliminate systemic pressures.

Heavier vehicles increase:
- material demand
- non-exhaust pollution
- infrastructure wear

Efficiency gains are often offset by larger vehicles and longer travel distances.  
The problem shifts, rather than disappears.

---

## V - Material Limits and Industrial Reality

Vehicles rely on steel, aluminum, copper, and increasingly conflict mineral.  
Their extraction carries environmental and social costs, often far from where the vehicles are used.

Recycling helps, but it is never complete.  
Material losses accumulate, and recycling alone cannot sustain unlimited growth in vehicle numbers, size, or complexity.

---

## VI - Designing Within Limits

Living within limits requires more than cleaner energy.  
It requires reducing **material intensity**, minimizing **mass per transported person**, and designing vehicles that:
- last
- can be repaired
- remain useful over time

Durability, repairability, and sufficiency are not constraints on innovation.  
They are strategies for resilience.

We treat planetary boundaries as **design constraints**.  
This means questioning size, weight, speed, and material choices not just for efficiency, but for their long-term ecological consequences.

The goal is not to optimize mobility in isolation, but to make it compatible with the limits of the world it depends on, **balancing human needs with planetary survival**.
