Private cars account for approximately **13% of Europe’s total greenhouse gas emissions**.  
Yet climate impact is only part of the problem.

For everyday mobility, cars are fundamentally inefficient and oversized.  
A typical car consumes **around 10 to 100 times more energy per kilometer** than a bicycle, while carrying on average **1.4 people in a 5-seat vehicle**.

**Most of the climate impact of cars comes from ordinary daily use: [roughly 80% of car kilometres and thus emissions, are accumulated on days with less than 50 km of driving.](https://wiki.unece.org/download/attachments/34209806/EVE-19-06e.pdf)**
These journeys rarely require long range, high speed, or large payloads, yet they are made with vehicles weighing over a ton and designed for highways.

This mismatch creates cascading effects:
- **Traffic congestion**, because large vehicles occupy too much road space compared the number of people moved.
- **Parking shortages**, as each trip requires storage at both ends.
- **Noise and danger**, particularly in dense urban environments.

Cars also impose a heavy **land footprint**.  
Roads, parking spaces, and safety margins reshape cities around the car’s worst-case size. Urban space is consumed by vehicles, pushing destinations farther apart and reinforcing car dependency.

Alternatives for short trips exist like bikes and e-bikes or public transport yet they are **not widely adopted**.
Furthermore, in rural areas, options are often even more limited: low population density can make public transport economically unviable, and distances are often too great for bikes or e-bikes to be practical.
This is not a failure of individuals, but of systems and design: in cities, habits, perceived safety, physical effort, exposure to weather, time variability, and the cognitive load of trip chaining favor the car; in rural areas, long distances and limited transport options make it the only feasible choice, even if inefficient.

The core issue is not that people choose cars.  
It is that **cars have become the default solution to problems they were never meant to solve**.
