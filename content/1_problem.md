# Cars are the wrong tool for most trips

Private cars account for approximately **13% of Europe’s total greenhouse gas emissions**.  
Yet climate impact is only part of the problem.

For everyday mobility, cars are fundamentally inefficient.  
A typical car consumes **around 10 to 100 times more energy per kilometer** than a bicycle, while carrying on average **1.4 people in a 5-seat vehicle**.

**80% of trips in Europe are under 10 km.**  
These journeys rarely require long range, high speed, or large payloads, yet they are made with vehicles weighing over a ton and designed for highways.

This mismatch creates cascading effects:
- **Traffic congestion**, because large vehicles occupy too much space for the number of people moved.
- **Parking shortages**, as each trip requires storage at both ends.
- **Noise and danger**, particularly in dense urban environments.

Cars also impose a heavy **land footprint**.  
Roads, parking spaces, and safety margins reshape cities around the car’s worst-case size. Urban space is consumed not by movement, but by stationary vehicles, pushing destinations farther apart and reinforcing car dependency.

Alternatives for short trips exist like bikes and e-bikes or public transport yet they are **not widely adopted**.  
This is not a failure of individuals, but of systems and design. Habits and value lock-in, perceived safety in traffic, physical effort, exposure to weather, time variability, and the cognitive load of trip chaining all favor the car, even when it is inefficient.

The core issue is not that people choose cars.  
It is that **cars have become the default solution to problems they were never meant to solve**.
